                <h4>Forged Rims</h4>
                <p>DDPerformance sees much more in its rims than just the decorative aspects. We use forged wheels and cast wheels. The former are complex to manufacture, but offer significant advantages in terms of strength and mass.</p>
                <p>The cast wheels offer except a sporty and elegant design a very good price-performance ratio without sacrificing quality.</p>

                <h4>Chassis</h4>
                <p>Speed ​​is of course a matter of performance - but it should also be secure at all times. Especially on curvy or mountainous terrain, therefore, the suspension is usually the speed limiting factor.</p>
                <p>So that the vehicles from DDPerformance can play their maximum performance at any time, as a manufacturer we put a lot of coordination work into the development of suitable spring-damper combinations or the individual adaptation of air suspensions.</p>

                <h4>Engine Tuning</h4>
                <p>The engine is considered the heart of an automobile - and where the heart is, also the passion glows. </p>
                <p>DDPerformance therefore devotes special care to the construction of its high-tech engines. The performance parameters are always chosen by the engineers in such a way that the basic aggregates can reach their full potential without losing their stability. Depending on the level of refinement, GEMBALLA therefore not only relies on modified control software, but also uses elaborately developed peripherals and its own turbochargers.</p>

                <h4>Interior</h4>
                <p>If you indulge in the luxury of a refined DDPerformance, you can also set your personal accents in the interior.</p>
                <p>As far as color design and references are concerned, the options are just as exclusive and broad as in the luxury furniture store. High-quality leather and fine fabrics - uni or patterned - add up to an individual dream ambience..</p>

                <h4>Brakes</h4>
                <p>DDPerformance's high-performance braking systems reduce unsprung masses compared to the standard brake thanks to their ultra-light design. This benefits both driving performance and handling. In order to realize these goals, GEMBALLA entered into an exclusive development cooperation with the experts of BREMBO.</p>

                <h4>Exhaust Systems</h4>
                <p>DDPerformance attaches great importance to the construction of its exhaust systems made of high-quality stainless steel. In addition, the GEMBALLA exhaust systems are visual style features</p>
                <p>Due to the flow-optimized design of the exhaust systems, the respective vehicle also gains a plus subjectively in performance.</p>
